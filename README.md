Experimental Java interface for igraph
======================================

**The code in this repo is not functional yet.** Currently its only purpose is
to archive the experimental Java interface that I (@ntamas) have started
developing for igraph years ago. The project got abandoned as I lost interest
in Java, but I guess that the project could be resurrected with fairly minimal
effort.

Please contact me (@ntamas) or add an issue to the issue tracker if you are
interested in working on this project.
